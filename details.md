# design & implementation details

this module uses [boxel-tree-to-dna-model](), from which we can translate into [various output formats]() using kwon an's [dna_design_lib])().

we use [boxels-to-tree]() to convert from the 3D array of boxels into the boxel tree that we use to make the DNA structure.

**TODO go into more detail about why we produce a graph to make the DNA structures**
